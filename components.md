You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here.

Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'?
